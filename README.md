I. Introduction (2 minutes)

Slide 1: Title Slide (As above)

Slide 2: Overview & Objectives

Briefly reiterate the CEO’s goal: Grow the subscription base.

State the data source: BrightTV user profiles and viewer transactions.

Agenda: User & Usage Trends, Influencing Factors, Content Recommendations, Growth Initiatives.

Mention data preparation: UTC to SA time conversion.

II. User & Usage Trends (5 minutes)

Slide 3: Overall Scale & User ID Trend

Highlight: 10,000 records, 10.4B UserID. This indicates a large volume of user activity.

Could you discuss the UserID vs. RecordDate2 chart? It exhibits consistent activity over time, although it may also experience some fluctuations. Note: The x-axis is difficult to read, so focus on the general trend. "We see consistent user activity over the observed period, with some potential seasonality that warrants further investigation."

Slide 4: Channel Preferences

Highlight: The bar chart showing Record Count by Channel2. Identify the top channels (Supersport, Trace TV, Cartoon Network, E! Entertainment, kykNET, Sawsee, Vuzu).

Insight: "Supersport and Trace TV are the most popular channels, indicating a strong interest in sports and music content."

Slide 5: User Demographics – Names

Highlight: "None" accounts for 79.8% of names. This is very important. It suggests a significant portion of users haven't provided a name, or there's a data quality issue.

Insight: "A large proportion of users have not provided their name, which limits our ability to personalize experiences. Data quality checks are needed."

Slide 6: User Activity by Date & Name

Highlight: Focus on the most frequent dates (2016/03/24, 2016/03/25, 2016/03/30).

Insight: "Viewing activity is concentrated around specific dates, suggesting potential events or promotions driving engagement."

III. Factors Influencing Consumption (5 minutes)

Slide 7: Provincial Viewing Patterns

Highlight: The pie chart showing UserID by Duration 2 and Province. Gauteng dominates (75%).

Insight: "Gauteng is the primary source of viewership, representing a significant opportunity for targeted marketing and content acquisition."

Slide 8: Gender & Duration

Highlight: The bar chart showing UserID by Duration 2 and Gender. It's difficult to interpret precisely due to the chart format, but it appears there's a relatively even split between male and female viewers.

Insight: "Viewing patterns are fairly balanced between male and female users, suggesting broad appeal of the content."

Slide 9: Duration & Channel

Highlight: The bar chart showing Record Count by Duration 2 and Channel2. Focus on which channels have the highest viewing duration.

Insight: "Supersport Live, Channel O, and ICC Cricket World Cup have the highest viewing duration, indicating highly engaging content."

Slide 10: Name & Date Correlation

Highlight: The chart showing Record Count by Name and RecordDate2. Focus on the most frequent names and dates.

Insight: "Certain users (Hyman, Randy, Cory) are highly active, potentially representing power users or influencers."

IV. Content Recommendations for Low Consumption Days (4 minutes)

Slide 11: Recap of Low Activity Dates (Refer back to Slide 6)

Identify the dates with lower viewing activity.

Slide 12: Targeted Content Strategy

Recommendation 1: "On low-activity days, promote content from channels with high viewing duration (Supersport, Channel O, ICC Cricket World Cup)."

Recommendation 2: "Leverage the popularity of Gauteng by running targeted promotions specifically for users in that province."

Recommendation 3: "Explore personalized recommendations based on the viewing habits of power users (Hyman, Randy, Cory)."

Recommendation 4: "Consider running promotions around specific events (e.g., sports matches, music releases) to drive engagement."

V. Initiatives to Grow User Base (3 minutes)

Slide 13: Growth Initiatives

Initiative 1: Data Quality Improvement: "Address the issue of missing names by implementing data collection strategies to improve user profiling."

Initiative 2: Gauteng Focus: "Invest in marketing campaigns specifically targeting Gauteng residents."

Initiative 3: Content Acquisition: "Acquire more content in popular genres (sports, music) to cater to existing user preferences."

Initiative 4: Personalized Recommendations: "Develop a recommendation engine to suggest content based on individual viewing history."

Initiative 5: Channel Partnerships: "Explore partnerships with channels like Supersport and Trace TV to offer exclusive content or promotions."

VI. Q&A (1 minute)

Key Considerations & Caveats:

Data Quality: The high percentage of "None" names is a major concern. Address this upfront.

Chart Readability: Some charts are difficult to interpret (e.g., UserID by Duration 2 and Gender). Simplify visualizations if possible.

Limited Data: The analysis is based on a limited set of visuals. More data would provide a more comprehensive understanding.

Timeframe: The analysis is based on a specific timeframe (presumably March 2016). Trends may have changed since then.
